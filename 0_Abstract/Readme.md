## WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM

A wiper control system for detecting an amount of raindrops landed on a windshield of a vehicle and driving a wipe operation of a wiper to wipe the landed raindrops. The wiper control system includes raindrop sensing means, average landed raindrop amount calculation means, vehicle acceleration sensing means, and wipe operation mode selection means. The raindrop sensing means is capable of detecting the amount of landed raindrops for each of a plurality of wipe cycles of the wiper. The average landed raindrop amount calculation means calculates an average value of the amount of landed raindrops for the plurality of wipe cycles. The vehicle acceleration sensing means detects an acceleration of the vehicle. The wipe operation mode selection means selects a wipe operation mode based on the acceleration of the vehicle and any one of the amount of landed raindrops and the average amount of landed raindrops.
In this project I explain about how wiper works based on stm32, an ARM based Microcontroller
